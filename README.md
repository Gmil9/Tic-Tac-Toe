# Tic Tac Toe

To play, start by running the main method function.

The game will pop up giving you several choices:
    1.) The board size you want (3,4,5, or 6) - Has to be 3 or greater, and didn't want it getting too big
    2.) If you want to play ultimate TTT or regular
    3.) After those 2, hit start and then you can choose 1 or 2 players.  1 allowing you to play against a computer
    
Now its just like normal Tic-Tac-Toe
However if you are playing ultimate, when you click on a tile, it will create a new mini 3x3 board,
the winner of that gets marked on the main board.
